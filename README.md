# 🏢 Seoul Apartment Price Prediction: Production-Ready ML Pipeline

This project is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to predict real estate transaction prices in Seoul. Beyond simple modeling, this repository demonstrates a **Solution Architect's approach** to building scalable AI services.

## 🚀 Project Vision
- **Goal**: Develop a robust regression model to predict apartment prices with minimal RMSE.
- **Target**: Deploy as a microservice on `bit-habit.com` to provide real-time valuation.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, FastAPI, Docker.

## 📈 Key Engineering Milestones
1. **Data Engineering**: Handling 1.1M+ transaction records and multi-source integration (Subway/Bus data).
2. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporating socio-economic factors (Gangnam-proximity, building age).
3. **Model Excellence**: Comparative analysis of Random Forest vs. Gradient Boosting Machines.
4. **Deployment**: CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
